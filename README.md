# InterviewQuestionnaire
- Questions:
Q1- How are you doing today?
Q2- What kind of activities do you do outside of school?
Q3- How long do they take, and how much time do you have to do other stuff?
Q4- Do you enjoy and want to do these activities?
Q5- What do you think should be improved about the app? The user interface?

- These were created on students' extracurricular activities outside of school. I wanted to obtain this data to know how other students are doing and how much they are doing compared to me. It helps me understand how Emerald High community's students are living. 

Notes: 
  ~ I was able to export the data for the project, but I did not have enough time to figure out how to view the CSV file. In Notepad, the encoding seemed wrong, and when I exported it into Google Drive, there was no preview available.
