# InterviewQuestionnaire
- Questions:
Q1- How are you doing today?
Q2- What kind of activities do you do outside of school?
Q3- How much time do they take, and how much time do you have left to do other stuff?
Q4- Do you enjoy and want to do these activities?
Q5- What do you think should be improved about the app? The user interface?

- These were created on the topic of students' extracurricular activities outside of school. I wanted to obtain this data to know how other students are doing and how much they are doing compared to me. It helps me understand what this community's students are doing and how their lives are going.
